<!--Salim, a software engineering consultant, receives a variable salary every month. He wants to create a Python script that helps him manage his monthly finances by calculating how much money will be allocated to different categories like savings, rent, and electricity, based on percentages of his salary.
Your task is to write a Python script that automates these calculations. The script should:
Ask Salim to input his salary for the month.
Ask Salim to input the name of the month he is storing the salary for.
Ask Salim to input the following percentages for: a) Savings b) Rent c) Electricity
The script should calculate and display:
The amount allocated to savings, rent, and electricity.
The total amount Salim spends on savings, rent, and electricity combined.
The remainder of Salim's salary after these expenses.
The monthly rent and electricity multiplied by 12 to estimate Salim's yearly rent and electricity costs.
Salim's total salary for the month raised to the power of 2 (just for fun).
Assume Salim saves an additional random amount (e.g., $50) each month, and you need to calculate how much would be left if this amount is divided by the total amount allocated to savings. 
Finally, the script should output all the results in a readable format.-->

            //Ask Salim for Inputs
            let salary = prompt("Enter your salary for the month:")
            let month = prompt("Enter the name of the month:")
            let savingsPercent = prompt("Enter the percentage of salary for savings:")
            let rentPercent = prompt("Enter the percentage of salary for rent:")
            let electricityPercent = prompt("Enter the percentage of salary for electricity:")

            //Calculations
            let savings = (savingsPercent / 100) * salary
            let rent = (rentPercent / 100) * salary
            let electricity = (electricityPercent / 100) * salary

            let totalExpenses = savings + rent + electricity
            let remainder = salary - totalExpenses

            //Get Yearly rent and electricity
            let yearlyRent = rent * 12
            let yearlyElectricity = electricity * 12

            //Final Salary
            let salarySquared = salary ** 2

            //Just random savings (Bonus)
            const randomSavingsAddition = 50
            let leftAfterRandomSavings = randomSavingsAddition / savings
